Finally, this mod would not have been possible without the [Default Base Mod](https://github.com/Gremious/StS-DefaultModBase), in addition to much help from the friendly people over on the [StS Modding Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/SlayTheSpire). In particular, Chrono's switch card class, featured in his mod [The Disciple](https://github.com/Tempus/The-Disciple), has been invaluable to us.
